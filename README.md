## TL;DR

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* use the app to track your favorite books

## What You're Getting

This is an application that keeps track of books.
Books you are reading, books you want to read, and books you have read.
There is a search page where new books can be searched for and added.

NOTE: The search API provided only lets certain terms through.
If you're having trouble getting results back, take a look at the `SEARCH_TERMS.md` file to see what will work.

## Why?

This app was developed as part of my coursework for the React Nanodegree course from Udacity. It's the first project out of three.

## How?

Udacity provided a starter repo/project (created using `create-react-app`) that included the markup and styles. So no..., I didn't style this myself.
